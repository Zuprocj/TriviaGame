# TriviaGame

Created a trivia game about Pokemon the game red/blue version. I used jQuery to manipulate the html.  Added some not so stylish CSS.  The majority of the time I spent was on the jQuery and javascript.  The html is very minimal.  I had to reduce some of the questions because it made the webpage too long, which the user would lose track of the timer.  I tried implementing a sticky header/footer for the timer but I was not successful.
The game itself is multiple choice. Only one choice is correct.  User can leave question blank.  There is a timer at the top of the webpage.  Once the counter reaches zero.  The game is over and the result page is then displayed.  The number of correct and inccorect answers are shown. Along with how many answers that were left unanswered.
